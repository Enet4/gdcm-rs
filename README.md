# gdcm-rs
Rust bindings for [GDCM](https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM).

Goal of this project is to provide an easy to use interface with GDCM.
This can be used to decode a wide variety of compressed dicoms.

## TODO
- [ ] Provide a similar interface as the [GDCM Python Wrapper](https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM/tree/master/Wrapping/Python)
